# Heroes-of-Pymoli
I have landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

After analyzing the data I have noticed 3 trends:
  1. The largest age bracket of players lie between ages 20 and 24. This group accounts for over for 44.79% of purchases. But while they have the most purchases, their average purchase value is second to a group almost twice their age, 35-39. 
  2. Oathbreaker is not only the most popular item in the game, its also the most profitable. 
  3. Men vastly outnumber women when it comes to purchases (652-113), but women slightly edge out men in average purchase price ($3.02 - $3.20). Admittely other/non disclosed players edge out both other categories when it comes to average price($3.35) but do to the small sample size (15) its hard to be sure if thats is a trend, or a few outliers.
