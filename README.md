# Heroes-of-Pymoli
I have landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. After pouring through the data here are 3 trends I picked up on first glance!

  1. The age bracket with the largest number of players lie between ages 20 and 24. This group accounts for over for 44.79% of purchases. But while they have the most purchases, their average purchase value is second to a group almost twice their age, 35-39. 
  2. Final Critic is not only the most popular item in the game, its also the most profitable. 
  3. Men vastly outnumber women when it comes to purchases (652-113), but women slightly edge out men in average purchase price ($3.02 - $3.20). Admittely other/non disclosed players edge out both other categories when it comes to average price($3.35) but do to the small sample size (15) its hard to be sure if thats is a trend, or a few outliers. 
  
When looking forward to new analysis that can be made from this set, I have a few main questions.

  1. Are there any similairties between the design/functionality of the most popualr items? If so this could be something to keep in mind when developing new potential items.
  2. Most players of this game fall between the ages of 15-29. What can we do to make sure that this group can keep enthralled in this game? 
  3. Further, similar to question 1, are there any items that are particularly popular to these age groups?
  
Finding these answers and acting on them can help keep Heroes of Pymoli one of the most beloved games of "insert indy game company here"
